# d3.BubbleMatrix
d3.js v3 code for creating a bubble matrix plot - can be used for visualizing status of items over time

(this documentation is in progress)

## Main File is Bubble_Multi.js

## Purpose
  - Provide d3.js code that will make a bubble matrix such that information on status over time of multiple items can be conveyed efficiently. 
  - Information can be conveyed through:
    - <i>color of bubbles</i> (red = trouble, green is good, yellow is caution, gray is no data)
    - <i>size of bubbles</i> (longer in red or yellow the larger the size)
    - <i>color of square background behind bubbles</i> (a status that changed color relative to previous has white background)
    - <i>names to left on y-axis</i> (categorical or unique names)
    - <i>names to right on y-axis</i> (categorical unique names)
    - <i>names above on x-axis</i> (usually time)
